Task-1

* In the create matrix code, the aim is to produce a matrix with a mixed alphabet and print to file. 

* In the encrypt text code, the first two characters of the objective matrix file are m and
We were holding n numbers (the dimensions of the matrix). Open the matrix file and put the contents in matrisdizi[ ]

* We hold Then return matrisdizi[] to matrix M[] [] by rotating the for loops m and n
we place. When reading the text to be encrypted, the characters we read from the file

* We keep it in the text to be sifrelenecekmetin[]. Each cell of the text to be encrypted using for loops
one by one we find which cell of the matrix M is equal to (j+1)*10 + (k+1)
we encrypt it and keep it in sifrelenmismetin[]. 

* We print the encrypted text to the file. Text
In the decryption code, we keep the file containing the matrix in dizi[]. for loops
We create the matrix M[] [] using the dizi[] and insert the dizi[] elements into it. cipher text

* We keep it in cryptoarray[]. Considering the elements of the encrypted array one by one, for example the first element
Let it be 25. The value of 25in in mod 10 is (-1)=j. We say 25/10=(i â€“ 1) and thus i int value
because it is an integer. M[i] We place the letter in [j] in the Sifresiz[] string.

* The Sifresiz[] string now contains the decrypted text. Copy the Sifresiz[] string to the desired file.
we are writing.
